/**
 * Represents the execution mode for an injection process.
 *
 * <p>This class determines how an injection should be executed:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Asynchronous</b> ({@code async=true}) - The injection is queued and executed in the
 *       background. Control returns immediately to the caller.
 *   <li><b>Synchronous</b> ({@code async=false}) - The injection is executed immediately and the
 *       caller waits for completion.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Asynchronous execution is typically preferred for long-running injections or when executing
 * multiple injections in parallel.
